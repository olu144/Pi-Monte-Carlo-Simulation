# Pi-Monte-Carlo-Simulation




The program estimates pi using Monte Carlo simulation
Virtual Dartboard has area 2 X 2 to accommodate unit circle.
The total area is 4.
Therefore, since area of unit circle = pi * radius^2 (and radius of 1 squared
  is 1), ratio of area of unit circle to area of board should be pi/4. If the entire board is filled with darts, counting
  the number of darts that fall within the circle divided by the
  total number of darts thrown should give us that ratio (i.e., 1/4 * pi)
  Therefore, multiplying that result by 4 will return an approx. of pi.
